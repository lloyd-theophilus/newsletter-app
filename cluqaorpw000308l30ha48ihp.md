AWS Transit Gateway simplifies network architecture by enabling seamless connectivity between virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. It acts as a hub that allows you to connect multiple VPCs and VPN connections. In this step-by-step guide, I will walk you through the process of setting up AWS Transit Gateway.

### **Key Features and Benefits**

**Centralized Network Hub**: AWS Transit Gateway serves as a centralized point for managing connectivity across multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, streamlining network administration and reducing complexity.

**Scalability**: It supports the seamless scaling of network connectivity as your infrastructure grows, accommodating increasing traffic and resource demands without disrupting existing connections.

**Transitive Routing**: With AWS Transit Gateway, you can establish transitive routing between interconnected networks, allowing traffic to flow between various VPCs and on-premises environments without the need for complex peering relationships.

**Integration with AWS Services**: Transit Gateway integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as Amazon VPC, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS VPN, providing a comprehensive networking solution tailored to the needs of cloud-based applications.

**Centralized Network Monitoring and Management**: It offers centralized monitoring and management capabilities, allowing administrators to gain insights into network traffic, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and enforce security policies effectively.

### **Implementation Guide**

* Sign in to AWS Console Navigate to the AWS Management Console and sign in using your credentials. NB: Make sure to have at least to VPCs created. [You can follow my previous article on how to set up a VPC](https://hashnode.com/post/clq00g8j0000408jm10izfudj)

    Navigate to Transit Gateway: Once you're logged in, go to the AWS Transit Gateway service by either typing "Transit Gateway" in the search bar or selecting it from the list of services under "Networking & Content Delivery.

    Create a Transit Gateway by clicking on the "Create Transit Gateway" button. You'll be prompted to provide details such as the name of your Transit Gateway, description, and Amazon side ASN (Autonomous System Number). You can leave the ASN as default since AWS will create it for you.

    Configure Attachments: After creating the Transit Gateway, the next step is to attach the VPCs. Click on "Create Transit Gateway attachment" and choose the type of attachment you want to create: VPC. For VPC attachments, select the VPC you want to attach from the dropdown menu.

    Route Table Configuration: Once the attachments are created, you need to configure route tables to enable routing between them. Navigate to the "Route Tables" tab and click on "Create Transit Gateway Route Table." Assign a name and description to the route table and associate it with the attachments you created earlier.

    Add Routes: In the route table configuration, add routes to specify how traffic should be routed between the attachments. You can define routes for VPC attachments, VPN attachments, and Direct Connect attachments if applicable. Specify the destination CIDR blocks and target attachments for each route.

* Propagate Routes (Optional): If you want routes to be automatically propagated to the route table from attached VPCs or VPN connections, you can enable route propagation. This ensures that any new subnets or VPN configurations are automatically added to the route table.
    
* Review and Save Configuration: Review all the configurations you've made for your Transit Gateway setup. Make sure everything is configured correctly according to your requirements. Once you're satisfied, click on "Save" or "Create" to finalize the setup.
    
* Testing Connectivity: After setting up the Transit Gateway, it's essential to test connectivity between the attached VPCs. You can use tools like Termius or Putty to SSH into the instances within the VPCs to verify connectivity across the network. NB: Remember to allow **All ICMP - IPv4 to 0.0.0.0** in your security group.
