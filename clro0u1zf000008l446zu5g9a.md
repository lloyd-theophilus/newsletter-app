Amazon Elastic IP (EIP) is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to allocate a static public IP address to your Amazon EC2 instances. Unlike dynamic IP addresses, Elastic IPs remain associated with your account until you choose to release them. This article will guide you through the step-by-step process of setting up AWS Elastic IP, along with key examples to illustrate the concepts.

### Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An AWS account: You need an active AWS account to access and manage AWS resources. If you don't know how to setup an AWS Account, please refer to my previous article on ["How to setup an AWS Account for the first time"](https://lloyd82.hashnode.dev/how-to-setup-an-aws-account-for-the-first-time)
    
2. An Amazon EC2 instance: Ensure that you have an EC2 instance already running in your AWS account.
    

**Now, let's proceed with the setup.**

**Step 1:** Access the AWS Management Console Log in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard Once logged in, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top left corner and clicking on "EC2" under the Compute section.

Step 3: Select Your EC2 Instance In the EC2 Dashboard, locate and select the EC2 instance to which you want to associate the Elastic IP. Click on the instance to highlight it.

Step 4: Allocate Elastic IP In the EC2 instance details pane, scroll down to the "Description" tab. Under the "Network" section, you will find the "IPv4 Public IP" field. Click on the "Associate Elastic IP" button next to it.

Step 5: Allocate Elastic IP Address In the "Allocate Elastic IP address" window, you can choose to allocate a new Elastic IP address or select an existing one from your account. If you're allocating a new one, click the "Allocate" button.

Step 6: Associate Elastic IP Address After allocation, click the "Associate" button to associate the Elastic IP address with your EC2 instance. Confirm the action in the prompt.

Step 7: Verify Elastic IP Association Go back to the EC2 Dashboard and select your instance. In the "Description" tab, you should see the allocated Elastic IP address associated with your instance in the "IPv4 Public IP" field.

### Key Example:

Using AWS CLI To allocate and associate an Elastic IP using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), you can use the following commands:

```plaintext
# Allocate Elastic IP
aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc
# Note the AllocationId from the output

# Associate Elastic IP with EC2 instance
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id YourInstanceId --allocation-id YourAllocationId
```

**Replace** `YourInstanceId` **and** `YourAllocationId` **with your actual EC2 instance ID and Elastic IP Allocation ID.**

### Conclusion:

Setting up AWS Elastic IP is a straightforward process that provides your EC2 instances with a static public IP address. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need a persistent address for your applications or services. Whether using the AWS Management Console or the CLI, following these steps ensures a smooth integration of Elastic IP into your AWS infrastructure.
